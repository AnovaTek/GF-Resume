    <p>I’m a medical field service engineer specialising in ultrasound systems, working across hospital clinics and veterinary practices up and down the country. My role sits at the intersection of technology and care, ensuring critical diagnostic equipment is reliable, safe, and performing at its best for the professionals who depend on it every day. I take pride in solving complex technical problems in real world environments where precision and trust truly matter.</p>

    <p>Beyond my work, I’m deeply family driven. I believe strongly in showing up for the people around me and doing everything I can to support, protect, and encourage those I care about. That sense of responsibility and commitment shapes how I work, how I learn, and how I approach challenges with patience, consistency, and a focus on long term impact rather than quick wins.</p>

    <p>I’m currently beginning a new chapter by developing my skills as a self taught software developer. Driven by curiosity and a desire to build meaningful, practical solutions, I’m expanding my technical toolkit beyond hardware into software, automation, and digital problem solving. This journey represents not just a career evolution, but a personal commitment to continuous learning and growth, combining hands on engineering experience with modern software development to create smarter, more connected solutions for the future.</p>
